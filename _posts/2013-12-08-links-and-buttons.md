title: Links and Buttons
---

<p>Had a great email exchange with a <a href="https://www.hanssprecher.com">friend</a> the other day and he got me thinking about links and buttons.  Something that I have begun to stick to and has helped improve my UI design is:</p>
 > links = underlined (except in Nav) = goes to a new page
 
 > buttons = form submit or on page action
